  Hi, I am TainÃ¡!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
<div style="text-align: justify"> I'm a Brazillian researcher from ParÃ¡ (north of Brazil in the Amazon region). Through this website, I'll share content such as science communication, tutorials, talks, and diverse themes about science and cute things ðŸ’œ Despite choosing English to begin, I intend as soon as possible to provide content in Portuguese and Spanish. Although having a common language is important for science communication, providing multilingual alternatives promotes equity, inclusion, and diversity in the scientific community and beyond that. Not least important, all content including the code to build this website is open and available on GitHub. I advocate for open science, thus my tools are open-source.
  Through this blog, I want to contribute to anyone who visits this space, and everybody is welcome!  Hope to help as well as the community helped me by adding a lot of learning. Finally, I want to say "Thank you very much!" to the R community, especially to curso-r, R-ladies, Beatriz Mills e Fernanda Kelly (there are many others here) ðŸ’œ
