<!-- this is a subheadline -->
<div style="text-align: justify"> I'm a driven 30-something Brazil from Pará.  As a biodiversity researcher, I'm proud to have done all my scientific education in Amazon regions Institutions.  I was moved to Rio de Janeiro where I finished my Ph.D. and geared my subsequent research towards the spatial analysis of biodiversity, focusing on the impact of global change (climate change and land-use and land-cover
changes).

Through this website I'll share content as science communications, tutorials,  talks,  diverse themes about science and cute things. It's in an ​early stage and despite choosing English to begin, I intend as soon as possible to provide content in Portuguese and Spanish. Although having a common language is important for science communication, provide multilingual alternatives promotes equity, inclusion and diversity in the scientific community and beyond that. 

Not least important, all content including the code to build this website is open and available on Github. I advocate for open science, thus my tools are open-source.


PS.: During my academic education in Brazil, I had the opportunity to live with people from different countries. At that time, I perceived that I was too much care about speaking the closest of native English, also imitating accents :smile: . While my friends from outside who lived in Brazil cared about being understood without imitating Brazilian accents, because of course, they are not Brazillian. Anyway, I still really care em say people's names rightly and in the right sidebar, you will found audio to correctly pronounce my name, enjoy! :purple_heart: </div>
