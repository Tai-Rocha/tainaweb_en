  What I'm up to lately...
  Beyond the research, Iâ€™m an R programming enthusiast (#rstats)  and also love Github and its features. 

  I like the beach, nature, bird watching (and taking pic of them), good beers (and good wines), good food, books (TAG lover <3), random TECH content and I can't live without music.
